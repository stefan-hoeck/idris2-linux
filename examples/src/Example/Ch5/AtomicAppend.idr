  Usage: linux-examples atomic_append DEST NUM_BYTES [x]

  Appends `NUM_BYTES` bytes to `DEST`, creating it, if it does not
  exist yet. In case of `x` being provided, this omits the `O_APPEND`
  flag and uses `lseek` to get to the end of the file insted.

  This can be used to demonstrate that with `O_APPEND`, writing to
  a file is an atomic operation, while the combination of `lseek`
  and `write` is not. In order to do so, try the following with
  and without the optional `x`s:

  linux-examples atomic_append build/out 10000 x & linux-examples atomic_append build/out 10000 x

  Note, how without the `x`s, you are guaranteed to get a file of 20'000 bytes,
  while with the `x`s, the file will be slightly above 10'000 bytes due to
  the race condition between the two processes writing to the file at
  the same time.
